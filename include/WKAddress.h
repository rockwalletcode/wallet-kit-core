/**
 * @brief An address represents an account address on a specific network.
 *
 * @discussion Different networks have different addresses and have different string
 * representations of addresses.  For example, an Ethereum address is 20 bytes that is 'printed'
 * as a '0x'-prefixed hex string with or without capitalization as a checksum.  Bitcoin has
 * 'legacy' and 'segwit' addresses.
